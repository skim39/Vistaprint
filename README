Vistaprint Project
Goal: Recommendation system for customers based on their
previous engagements with Vistaprint. The goal is to create an improved 
relevant and personalized experience for customers. 
Paths to follow:
These questions act as guidelines as to how we can create a system
that is able to forecast the users needs, therbey creating a more
personalized experience- 
- How does the customer interact with the product?
- What features are indicative of what a customer would interact with?
  (user features)
- What design traits or features are more popular than others?
  (design features)
- Combine user features(purchase patterns, etc.), design features,
  and interaction features to gain insight to personalizing the user
  experience. 

These questions aid us in the design of this customer recommendation
system for Vistaprint.
