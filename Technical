These notes are for problems and solutions encountered with 
our software tools. We primarily would use Spyder in Anaconda, 
but you are welcome to use any python or R interpreter. 

First off, we need to access the data. 
The data is stored as a paraquet file, which is a good extension
for handling hugee datasets. 
To open this: 
Go to your terminal 
Enter: conda info --envs (displays list of anaconda environments)
Enter: source activate [the name of your conda environment]
Once the environment is active. You would see the name next to the
command prompt. 
Enter: update pandas
Once that is done. 
Enter: conda install pyarrow -c conda-forge
Once that is done
Enter: conda install fastparquet -c conda-forge
